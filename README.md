<h3 align="center">Modular Optimization-based Inverse Kinematics of a UR5e Arm in Mujoco</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A modular optimization framework to control the end effector of an industrial robotic arm solely based on the euclidean norm between goal pose and the actual pose of the end effector -- IK agnostic control (no need for IK equations)

## Control Methodology

The end effector of the UR5e robotic arm is controlled using local optimization techniques. The control approach utilizes:

- The `scipy.minimize` library for optimization.
- A custom gradient descent algorithm based on the Jacobian transpose method.

### Tools involved

* Mujoco (latest)
* Python - scipy.optimize and numpy libraries
* Constrained Optimization (knowledge required)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Steps to setup the framework in your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Install the MuJoCo and SciPy libraries using pip to ensure the code runs without errors.
* pip
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install mujoco scipy numpy
  ```

### Installation
Considering that you have the prerequisites
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Poorna-Sasank/mujoco_ik_simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to optim_kinematic_control folder
   ```sh
   cd path/to/mujoco_ik_simulation/optim_kinematic_control
   ```
3. Choose your desired optimization framework and run the main code :)
   <br />
   * You can choose your optimization framework in the main code itself

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Should you require any further clarifications on mujoco or optimization techniques please refer to their respective documentations

_For mujoco, please refer to the [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python.html)_
